Scripts for working with Dreamtonic's SynthesizerV application


To install an individual script, you can click on the script name, then press the 
little copy icon in the upper right of the file ("Copy raw contents"), then open a 
text file and paste the contents there. 

Save the text file with the same name as it has here into your scripts folder. 
(To find your scripts folder: in SynthV, go to the scripts menu and then click "Open Scripts Folder" 
in  the Scripts menu.)

To install all scripts, go to https://github.com/billwhite-git/synthvscripts, click on the green "<>Code" button, 
and select Download ZIP. After the zip is downloaded, copy its contents into your Scripts folder.
